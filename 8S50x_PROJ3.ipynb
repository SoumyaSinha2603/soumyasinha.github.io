Below the critical temperature, the system exhibits long-range ordered spins, with all spins aligning in the same direction, resulting in a net magnetization.

One approach would be to flip the spins one-by-one, which is just far too time-consuming. If taking this approach (which you could try), you have to be mindful of randomly choosing spins, in order to avoid any bias.\n",

Now, it turns out that random, Poisson updates of multiple spins can produce the right phase transition, but we will take a more effective approach.\n",

Using this can lead to better analysis of data. Moreover, we can ask ourselves this question: if we can accurately predict properties of materials, can we use this to advance our understanding?"
